# Small OOP Project with CMake

After writing a simple parent-child class structure I displayed the students by using the main.cpp script.

## Features

- built and configured with cmake
- uses OOP

## Tech

SumClasses uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [C++ 14]
- [VisualCode] or any editor of choice
- [CMake min v3.1]

## Installation

It requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and a [C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) compiler to run.


#### Building for source

Go to the build subdirectory

```sh
cmake .
```

```sh
cmake --build .
```

Run the exe

```sh
sumClasses.exe
```
